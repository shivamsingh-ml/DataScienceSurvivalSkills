# DataScienceSurvivalSkills
Data Science Survival Skills Homework 5 files can be found in this github repository. We learnt several git commands in this homework, such as clone, push, pull, checkout, add, commit, and so on. Following that, we learnt how to create a pip installable github repository, for which we utilized a python program that produces different colored snowflakes using the turtle python package.


# Installing the Snowflake package
To install the snowflake package on your own system, run 'pip install git+'https://github.com/shivamsingh-ml/DataScienceSurvivalSkills.git'.
